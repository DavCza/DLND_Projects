# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation

### Project 1: [Your first neural network](https://github.com/DavCza/DLND-your-first-network)

building and applying a basic neural network to predict the number of future bike rentals using a real world dataset of a bike rental company that contained statistical data of over two years of business.

### Project 2: [Image Classification](https://github.com/DavCza/DLND-image-classification)

building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using _TensorFlow_ to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Project 3: [Generate TV Scripts](https://github.com/DavCza/DLND-tv-script-generation)

building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using _TensorFlow_ to generate a new examplary Simpsons TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern using a dataset that contains extracts of Simpsons scripts from 27 seasons.

### Project 4: [Translate a Language](https://github.com/DavCza/DLND-language-translation)

building a RNN on a Sequence to Sequence model (seq2seq) using _TensorFlow_that translates new sentences from English to French and train it on a small, basic dataset of English and French phrases.

### Project 5: [Generate Faces](https://github.com/DavCza/DLND-face-generation)

building a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using _TensorFlow_ to generate novel faces when trained on the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA).
